                         <p><b> Trapholt is a museum of modern art, crafts and design with unique architecture and scenic location down to Kolding fjord.
                           <br><br> Trapholt is a national cultural lighthouse in the design city of Kolding, which is a member of UNESCO's Creative Cities Network.</b>
                            
                           <br><br> The architecture of the museum is in itself an attraction. Built around the central museum street, the exhibition spaces open up for 
                           exciting spatial experiences. Outside is the powerful, sculptural wall that delimits the museum to a large sculpture park with works by Danish 
                           contemporary artists.
                            
                           <br><br>        Participation is central to Trapholt. The museum shows new paths both nationally and internationally through sensuous exhibitions,
                            inclusive projects and research that expands the framework for what is meant by an art museum, what experiences one can expect and new forms of 
                            interaction.
                            
                          <br> <br>  Trapholt offers changing exhibitions every year and has, among other things, Denmark's largest chair collection of more than 500 chairs 
                          from the 20th century. Trapholt establishes inclusive projects in collaboration with artists, where citizens are invited to participate with concrete 
                          creative contributions or personal resources that can create change.
                            
                           <br><br>  Arne Jacobsen's Kubeflex cottage is a total experience for the design and architecture-interested audience; the only one of its kind 
                           and decorated with Jacobsen's own designs. At the museum, a special hall is dedicated to paintings by Richard Mortensen - a hall that has been 
                           created in close collaboration with the artist himself.
                            
                           <br><br> In Café Gustav Lind it is possible to enjoy the view of Kolding Fjord and in Trapholt Designbutik a wide selection of interior design 
                           from Danish and international brands is presented.
                            
                           <br><br> There is free parking right at the door for cars and buses. Trapholt is handicap friendly.
                            <br><br>On Saturday night, Trapholt won the European Museum Award 'The Artmuseum Award 2021'. Behind the award is The European Museum Academy
                             (EMA), which represents over 40 member countries.
                            <br><br>Trapholt - Museum of Modern Art and Design was presented with cultural life's new industry award on Monday evening. Karen Grøn, 
                            director of Trapholt, received the award and winner for the two citizen-involved art projects "LIGHTHOPE" and "Close to Trees", which 
                            ensured that Trapholt never closed under the corona.
                            The award was presented at the industry meeting: The Cultural Life of the Future, where a united Danish cultural life across cultural 
                            industries and art forms shared knowledge and exchanged ideas about new initiatives in cultural life during the corona crisis.
